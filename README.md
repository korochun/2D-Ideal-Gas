A particle gas simulator written in Java and AWT.

## Tutorial

A tutorial is available
[here](https://github.com/korochun/2D-Ideal-Gas/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md).

## Future

Although this project is old and inactive, there are a few possible improvements
if I do get to working on it again:

- use OpenGL instead of AWT to increace performance
- rewrite in rust for the same reason
- rework the collision system to allow for interpolation
